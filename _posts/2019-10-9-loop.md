```
for num in [1,2,3]
  puts num
end
```
```
[1,2,3].each {|num| puts num}
```


2. Ternary operator [if/else] > only 2 condition

```
age = 20 
if age > 18 
  puts "Adult"
else
  puts "Boy"
```

```
#condition ? code_when_truthy : code_when_falsey
score= 50
result = score > 40 ? 'Pass' : 'Fail'
puts result
```


3. if elsif elsif else = Case / when  > several condition 
```
num = 42
case num
when 1
  puts "one"
when 2
  puts "two"
when 42
  puts "the answer!"
else
  puts "nope"
end
```
Don't forget the else statement at the end if you want to be exhaustive!
