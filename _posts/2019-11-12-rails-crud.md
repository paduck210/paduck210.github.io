1. What rails do for me?

```ruby
rails db:drop     # Drops the database (lose all your data!)
rails db:create   # Creates the database with an empty schema
rails db:migrate  # Runs pending migrations on the database schema
rails db:seed     # Runs seeds.rb file
rails db:rollback # Revert the last migration
rails db:reset    # Drops database + replays all migration + runs seed
```
