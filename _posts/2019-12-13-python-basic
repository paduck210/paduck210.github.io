f string is new cocept. <br>
Similar with Ruby's `#{}` thing. <br> 
Can put function inside of {}.

```python
name = " eric "
print(f"Hello, {name.strip()} would you like to learn some Python today?")

print(name.lower())
print(name.upper())
print(name.title())

harry = f"{name.title().strip()} Differences of habit \nand language are nothing at all \n\tif our aims are identical \n\tand our hearts are open"
print(harry)
```
